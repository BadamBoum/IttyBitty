sentence=With the fastest possible Arduino-compatible GPIO and register manipulation...it's the biggest of hits when you need to bang bits.
paragraph=Getting tired of mindlessly staring down your wristwatch in an open-mouthed gape, awaiting a digitalRead's return?  Do you long for a super-simple way to set or flip your bits?  (We all privately do, after all, though never admitting it.)  Has repeatedly ALT-TABing to the ATmega datasheets to look up register descriptions worn you down to the last raw nerve?  Then, golly gee, was this lib made for you!  In fact, it was made for all the little people, whether Arduino n00bs, ignorant to the time their programs waste on the simplest tasks, or AVR gurus who, being uber-smart embedded gods, never gave a second thought to seeking an easier way to bang their bits.  But most of all, this library is for the wretched, cursed signals stuck in the maze of your Arduino's buffers, for it is they who fly through pin lines at the speed of light in copper only to quietly suffer the most indignant fate at the hands of non-performant source code: waiting.  So set those bits free with a little help from these friends - a simple, elegant library that will give your code real legs and, more importantly, make the process that much more funner.
